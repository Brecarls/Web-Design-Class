Using the last assignment we wanted to create a checkers board where the pieces can move. So this assignment we went over creating a game of checkers. We use an array to create the placement of the the pieces. Created a function that created the board and ran for loops to place the board similar to the last assignment. Then we add the pieces based on how the array is set up running the createPiece function to do so. Then getPlayerPieces is used to target the piece the play selects. And finally the movePiece function takes the target and moves it to the clicked space.
